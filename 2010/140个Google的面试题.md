某猎头收集了140多个Google的面试题，都张到他的Blog中了，主要是下面这些职位的，因为被墙，且无任何敏感信息，所以，我原文搬过来了。

* Product Marketing Manager
* Product Manager
* Software Engineer
* Software Engineer in Test
* Quantitative Compensation Analyst
* Engineering Manager
* AdWords Associate



这篇Blog例举了Google用来面试下面这几个职位的面试题。很多不是很容易回答，不过都比较经典与变态，是Google，Microsoft，Amazon之类的公司的风格。对于本文，我没有翻译，因为我相信，英文问题是最好的。不过对于有些问题，我做了一些注释，不一定对，但希望对你有帮助启发。对于一些问题，如果你百思不得其解，可以Google一下，StackOverflow或是Wikipedia上可能会给你非常全面的答案。



**Product Marketing Manager**

* Have you ever used Google’s products? Gmail?
* What’s a creative way of marketing Google’s brand name and product?
* If you are the product marketing manager for Google’s Gmail product, how do you plan to market it so as to achieve 100 million customers in 6 months?
* How much money you think Google makes daily from Gmail ads?
* Name a piece of technology you’ve read about recently. Now tell me your own creative execution for an ad for that product.

* What is the most efficient way to sort a million integers?  （陈皓：merge sort）
* How would you re-position Google’s offerings to counteract competitive threats from Microsoft?
* How many golf balls can fit in a school bus? （陈皓：这种题一般来说是考你的解题思路的，注意，你不能单纯地把高尔夫球当成一个小立方体，其是一个圆球，堆起来的时候应该是错开的——也就是三个相邻的球的圆心是个等边三角形）
* You are shrunk to the height of a nickel and your mass is proportionally reduced so as to maintain your original density. You are then thrown into an empty glass blender. The blades will start moving in 60 seconds. What do you do?
* How much should you charge to wash all the windows in Seattle?

* Every man in a village of 100 married couples has cheated on his wife. Every wife in the village instantly knows when a man other than her husband has cheated, but does not know when her own husband has. The village has a law that does not allow for adultery. Any wife who can prove that her husband is unfaithful must kill him that very day. The women of the village would never disobey this law. One day, the queen of the village visits and announces that at least one husband has been unfaithful. What happens? （陈皓：这个问题很有限制级，哈哈，非常搞的一个问题，注意wife们的递归，这类的问题是经典的分布式通讯问题，上网搜 一搜吧。）
* In a country in which people only want boys, every family continues to have children until they have a boy. If they have a girl, they have another child. If they have a boy, they stop. What is the proportion of boys to girls in the country?（陈皓：第一反应是——这个国家是中国。一个概率问题，其实，无论你怎么生，50%的概率是永远不变的。）

The bridge is too dangerous to cross without a flashlight, and it’s only strong enough to support two people at any given time. Each of the campers walks at a different speed. One can cross the bridge in 1 minute, another in 2 minutes, the third in 5 minutes, and the slow poke takes 10 minutes to cross. How do the campers make it across in 17 minutes?（陈皓：经典的过桥问题）
* You are at a party with a friend and 10 people are present including you and the friend. your friend makes you a wager that for every person you find that has the same birthday as you, you get $1; for every person he finds that does not have the same birthday as you, he gets $2. would you accept the wager?

* You have five pirates, ranked from 5 to 1 in descending order. The top pirate has the right to propose how 100 gold coins should be divided among them. But the others get to vote on his plan, and if fewer than half agree with him, he gets killed. How should he allocate the gold in order to maximize his share but live to enjoy it? (Hint: One pirate ends up with 98 percent of the gold.)
* You are given 2 eggs. You have access to a 100-story building. Eggs can be very hard or very fragile means it may break if dropped from the first floor or may not even break if dropped from 100th floor. Both eggs are identical. You need to figure out the highest floor of a 100-story building an egg can be dropped without breaking. The question is how many drops you need to make. You are allowed to break 2 eggs in the process. （陈皓：从3的倍数的楼层开始扔，比如3，6，9，12…..，如果鸡蛋在3n层碎了，那到在3n-1层扔第二个鸡蛋，如果没碎，则最高不碎楼层为3n-1，否则为3n-2）
* Describe a technical problem you had and how you solved it.
* How would you design a simple search engine?
* Design an evacuation plan for San Francisco.

* What are three long term challenges facing Google?
* Name three non-Google websites that you visit often and like. What do you like about the user interface and design? Choose one of the three sites and comment on what new feature or project you would work on. How would you design it?
* If there is only one elevator in the building, how would you change the design? How about if there are only two elevators in the building? （陈皓：经典的电梯设计问题，这种问题千变万化，主要是考你的设计能力和需求变化的适变能力，与此相似的是酒店订房系统。）

You must write a the question on a card which and give it to Eve who will take the card to Bob and return the answer to you. What must you write on the card, besides the question, to ensure Bob can encode the message so that Eve cannot read your phone number?（陈皓：协议+数字加密，我试想了一个，纸条上可以这样写，“Bob，请把我的手机号以MD5算法加密后的字符串，比对下面的字符串——XXXXXX，它们是一样的吗？”）

* Tree search algorithms. Write BFS and DFS code, explain run time and space requirements. Modify the code to handle trees with weighted edges and loops with BFS and DFS, make the code print out path to goal state.
* You are given a list of numbers. When you reach the end of the list you will come back to the beginning of the list (a circular list). Write the most efficient algorithm to find the minimum # in this list. Find any given # in the list. The numbers in the list are always increasing but you don’t know where the circular list begins, ie: 38, 40, 55, 89, 6, 13, 20, 23, 36. （陈皓：循环排序数组的二分查找问题）

* Suppose you have an NxN matrix of positive and negative integers. Write some code that finds the sub-matrix with the maximum sum of its elements.（陈皓：以前见过一维数组的这个问题，现在是二维的。感觉应该是把二维的第一行的最大和的区间算出来，然后再在这个基础之上进行二维的分析。思路应该是这个，不过具体的算法还需要想一想）

These are the particulars: 1) You are given 12 servers to work with. They are all dual-processor machines with 4Gb of RAM, 4x400GB hard drives and networked together.(Basically, nothing more than high-end PC’s) 2) The log data has already been cleaned for you. It consists of 100 Billion log lines, broken down into 12 320 GB files of 40-byte search terms per line. 3) You can use only custom written applications or available free open-source software.
* There is an array A[N] of N numbers. You have to compose an array Output[N] such that Output[i] will be equal to multiplication of all the elements of A[N] except A[i]. For example Output[0] will be multiplication of A[1] to A[N-1] and Output[1] will be multiplication of A[0] and from A[2] to A[N-1]. Solve it without division operator and in O(n).（陈皓：注意其不能使用除法。算法思路是这样的，把output[i]=a[i]左边的乘积 x a[i]右边的乘积，所以，我们可以分两个循环，第一次先把A[i]左边的乘积放在Output[i]中，第二次把A[i]右边的乘积算出来。我们先看第一次的循环，使用迭代累积的方式，代码如下：for(r=1; i=0; i<n-1; i++){ Output[i]=r; r\*=a[i]; }，看明白了吧。第二次的循环我就不说了，方法一样的。）
* There is a linked list of numbers of length N. N is very large and you don’t know N. You have to write a function that will return k random numbers from the list. Numbers should be completely random. Hint: 1. Use random function rand() (returns a number between 0 and 1) and irand() (return either 0 or 1) 2. It should be done in O(n).（陈皓：本题其实不难。在遍历链表的同时一边生成随机数，一边记录最大的K个随机数和其链接地址。）
* Find or determine non existence of a number in a sorted list of N numbers where the numbers range over M, M>> N and N large enough to span multiple disks. Algorithm to beat O(log n) bonus points for constant time algorithm.（陈皓：使用bitmap，如果一个长整形有64位，那么我们可以使用M/64个bitmap）
* You are given a game of Tic Tac Toe. You have to write a function in which you pass the whole game and name of a player. The function will return whether the player has won the game or not. First you to decide which data structure you will use for the game. You need to tell the algorithm first and then need to write the code. Note: Some position may be blank in the game। So your data structure should consider this condition also.
* You are given an array [a1 To an] and we have to construct another array [b1 To bn] where bi = a1\*a2\*…\*an/ai. you are allowed to use only constant space and the time complexity is O(n). No divisions are allowed.（陈皓：前面说过了）
* How do you put a Binary Search Tree in an array in a efficient manner. Hint :: If the node is stored at the ith position and its children are at 2i and 2i+1(I mean level order wise)Its not the most efficient way.（陈皓：按顺序遍历树）

A = i1 i2 i3 … iN c1 c2 c3 … cN.Write an in-place algorithm to rearrange the elements of the array ass A = i1 c1 i2 c2 … in cn（陈皓：这个算法其实就是从中间开始交换元素，代码：for(i=n-1; i>1; i++) {  for(j=i; j<2\*n-i; j+=2) { swap(a[j], a[j+1]); } }，不好意思写在同一行上了。）
