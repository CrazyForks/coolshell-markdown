# 关于Amazon云宕机的网贴收集
>date: 2011-04-27T22:49:07+08:00


最近，互联网上最大的事可能是Amazon的AWS宕机了，而且好几天都没有完全恢复。整个Internet都在讨论这个事，Internet很不高兴，后果可能很严重。可能是因为这个事件对中国没有影响，所以中文这边相关的文章不多，大家可以参考一下和讯网的这篇《[伤不起！亚马逊史前最大宕机事件的启示](http://tech.hexun.com/2011-04-24/128998619.html)》。


国外有人把所有和这个事件相关的贴子都收集了起来，都是一些相当不错的贴子和文章，尤其是一些经验教训的贴子，很受教，转给大家看看。这个贴子的[来源在这里](http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/4/25/the-big-list-of-articles-on-the-amazon-outage.html)。

	+ PBS was affected for a while primarily because we do use EBS-backed RDS databases. Despite being spread across multiple availability-zones, we weren’t easily able to launch new resources ANYWHERE in the East region since everyone else was trying to do the same. I ended up pushing the RDS stuff out West for the time being.  [From Comment](http://don.blogs.smugmug.com/2011/04/24/how-smugmug-survived-the-amazonpocalypse/#comment-4737)
