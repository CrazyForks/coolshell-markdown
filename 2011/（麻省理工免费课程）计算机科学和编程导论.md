# （麻省理工免费课程）计算机科学和编程导论
>date: 2011-02-28T08:25:07+08:00


以前本站推荐过[麻省理工的C/C++的课程](/2010/%EF%BC%88%E9%BA%BB%E7%9C%81%E7%90%86%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%8D%E8%B4%B9%E8%AF%BE%E7%A8%8B%EF%BC%89C%E8%AF%AD%E8%A8%80%E5%86%85%E5%AD%98%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E5%92%8CC%2B%2B%E9%9D%A2%E5%90%91%E5%AF%B9%E8%B1%A1%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B.md)，今天在他们的网站看到上有一组关于[计算机科学和编程导论的免费公开课](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/video-lectures/)（视频是Youtube的），我看了几个课程，我觉得讲得很系统啊，而且有一点一通百通的感觉。虽然是理论课，但是可以感到我国的教育还是有很大差距的。这个组课程推荐给大家（需要翻墙），视频都有字幕，计算机科学系毕业的同学应该会很容易听懂。强烈推荐。（网友Aslan指出已经有人搬运到优酷上了，[链接在这里](http://www.youku.com/playlist_show/id_3940564_ascending_1_mode_pic_page_1.html)，遗憾的是没有字幕，另外，不知道为什么会说是Python学习）
